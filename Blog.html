         <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments.Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

            <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you�耱l miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

            <p>2019’s Lion King is a visual extravaganza to savor. Everything you see on screen is etched out with spellbinding detailing and the visual finesse gives way to near perfection. Some scenes especially ones with the fire flies in the night, open starlit skies and expansive views of the forest look stunning. Where the visual appeal falls short is in the expressions and emotions on the faces, especially the eyes of the animals which the animated version had got so right. So while you do feel sad when Mufasa is killed, you are not particularly moved to tears like with the original. And while Scar looks evil, he is not menacing. Also though the film is thirty minutes lengthier it pretty much remains an almost scene by scene copy of the 1994 version, losing its potential to surprise and intrigue further.</p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Legos, those fine, multi-colored plastic blocks – look simple, but together, they can be built up into many complex structures. For nearly four generations, they have served our creative childhoods. Now, the world’s largest toymaker is planning to take a leap into the next level – a sustainable one – a non-plastic one.A couple of years back, a Japanese company Colors Tokyo made Lego-style blocks out of sawdust, cedar bark shavings, coffee beans, and green tea leaves. Another Japanese design studio, Mokurukku, created them out of durable woods like maple and birch.
        Now, LEGO itself is planning to spend DKK 1 billion (approx $150 million) through their new LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre in Denmark, whose structure and organisation will be developed during 2015 and 2016, and employ a team of 100 specialists to research, develop and implement new sustainable alternatives for their current building materials. The toymaker has announced that they are aiming to replace the plastic in their products with a sustainable material by 2030.</p>
